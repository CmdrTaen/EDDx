# EDDx - Elite Dangerous Data extractor

This plugin does exactly one thing; export your scan data in the same layout that is produced by EDDiscovery. Why not just use EDD in that case? (I mean, it's an absolutely fantastic program) Because it doesn't export data on Planetary Rings or Stellar Rings. 

What does it do? It adds a panel in EDMC's settings with some text and a single large button. The only time it will do anything is if you press said button, at which point it will go through all of your Elite Dangerous journal files and extract the afore-mentioned scan data. This is likely to result in the program freezing for a few seconds if you have quite a bit of data to parse. After it's done, a .csv file will be saved to EDMC's default save directory.  

## Installation

1. Download the latest version 
2. Unpack the archive into the EDMC plugins directory.

## Usage

Go into Settings, find the EDDx tab, and then click on the only button.
