# EDDx - Elite Dangerous Data eXtractor

This plugin does exactly one thing; export your scan data in the same layout that is produced by EDDiscovery. Why not just use EDD in that case? (I mean, it's an absolutely fantastic program) Because it doesn't export data on Planetary Rings or Stellar Rings. 

## Installation

1. Download the latest version 
2. Unpack the archive into the EDMC plugins directory.

## Usage

Go into Settings, find the EDDx tab, and then click on the only button.
